## What is OOP?

A programming paradigm that organizes and models software.

## What is paradigm?

The style used to write and organize code.

### 1. Procedural programming

Procedural programming is a coding approach that organizes a computer program into a set of structured procedures or functions. These procedures consist of a series of well-defined steps or instructions that are executed sequentially. However, it may lack the flexibility and reusability of more advanced programming paradigms.

### 2. Functional programming

Functional programming is like using a set of building blocks that are like mathematical functions. This helps in making your code easier to understand and less likely to have bugs.

### 3. Declarative Programming

Declarative programming is an approach to writing computer outcome or result, rather than explicitly specifying the step-by-step instructions to achieve that outcome. In declarative programming, you define what you want to accomplish, and the underlying system or framework figures out how to achieve.

### 4. Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes defining data and behavior. In OOP, software is designed by modeling real-world entities as objects, each having attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.

### 5. Event Driven Programming

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm that resolves around responding to events or signals generated by the system or user interactions. In event-driven programming, software is designed to wait for and react to events, such as user clicks, keyboard inputs or system notifications.

### Building Blocks of OOP

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
